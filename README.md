# HTML-Table-Reference
Built from given sample site. I visually matched my site to theirs and used DevTools to find font, colors, and width.

Sample site: https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html?_gl=1*1ee9p3t*_ga*NDI0NTA2MjE1NS4xNjY4NTQ0NjQ5*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY2OTc1Nzk5OS4yMy4xLjE2Njk3NjE2NjkuNTYuMC4w

First, I guessed on colors and fonts and matched my site close to theirs. I learned about adding keywords to HTML via "&lt" for eg. Then, I Inspected their site to use DevTools to see specific colors, "rebeccapurple" instead of "purple". I also needed the width of the table because it didn't shrink past a point during resizing the window. Finally, viewing their source I found I used semantic HTML like <section> and they didn't. 

I learned the project may be straightforward, include some new material ("&lt"), and take the most time entering table data! 

I like creating HTML and CSS to match given site mockups, I've created a few now and working with a design spec was my favorite.
